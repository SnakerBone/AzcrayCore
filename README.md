Core Functionality For Azcray\
This mod completely overrides and disables many vanilla minecraft mechanics with a "crazy" twist, aiming to force the player to use mods\

### Note: This mod is not meant to be "High Quality", I am making this mod to absolutely munt minecraft (the gameplay) to its limit\
