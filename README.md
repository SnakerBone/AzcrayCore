Azcray Core (WIP) <br />
---
Core Functionality For Azcray <br />
This mod completely overrides and disables many vanilla minecraft mechanics with a "crazy" twist, aiming to force the player to use mods <br />
---
### Note: This mod is not meant to be "High Quality", I am making this mod to absolutely munt minecraft (the gameplay) to its limit <br />

## Features (WIP) <br />
> - Eating any food item (from minecraft) will give you every status effect in the game for ~100+ ticks <br />
> - Annoying teleportation status effect that teleports you to a random minecraft:air block within a 16x16x16 radius every so often <br />
---
## In progress <br />
> - Disabling tool and weapons from minecraft <br />
> - Disabling many loot table conditions from minecraft:blocks unless tool used on said block is not from minecraft <br />
> - Disabling spawn conditions for all entities (including boss entities, deprecated entities & modded entities) <br />
> + More TBA <br />
